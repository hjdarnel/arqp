## Purpose

A React SPA to allow uploading amateur radio log files in a standardized format, parse the score and relevant details, and display results for any past or current contest. Specially attention is paid to reusability, displaying past results, and allowing analytics of results by category.

## Tech

The app is a React/TypeScript frontend, supported with [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/), built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The backend ORM is [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and the database is a serverless instance of [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). 

Hosting is entirely free for our load!
